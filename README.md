# Hi, I'm Sarah G. Randol

**Applied Mathematician | Data Analyst | AI and Modeling Specialist**

I am an applied mathematician and data professional passionate about connecting mathematical modeling, data analytics, and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems.  
I recently completed my M.A. in Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computation at Bowling Green State University (BGSU), where my research introduced a Newton–Finite Difference Method (NFDM) for solving elliptic and parabolic PDEs with nonlinear interface jump conditions.  

My work involves both analytical modeling and data-driven insight generation, combining numerical precision with real-world applications in different fields.
